//This is a list of stuff I'd like to do:

1. New vew controller that displays a list of users who own "item lists" on Homepwner.

2. New models that represent the lists for each user of the system.

3. Updated itemViewControllers for each unique user of my system.


//Might be interesting.


**Bugs**
>The keyboard needs to go away.
>Images seemed to be lost after a rebuild/deploy but items dont't. Images seem to persist when you simply take focus off of the app and put it back into focus. (FIXED)
>If you add a dollar sign $ in front of the value then no value is returned on the display.
>Image are no longer deleted even though there seems to be specific code to delete tehm on page 174. Might have something to do with the way that I implemented the hack for deletebutton.hidden = yes.
